# quant
*quant* is aimed at providing [financial engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_engineering)
modules. *quant* is not limited to specifically [financial applications of
mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_finance), but also
involves subjects pertaining to the responsibilities of a [quantitative
analyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analyst). There is a lot of
overlap between OR and quantitative finance. Risk management is a good example
of this. Various modeling methodologies in quantitative finance share
similarities with both operations research and data science. For this reason
*quant* is integrated with this library.
