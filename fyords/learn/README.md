# learn
*learn* is aimed at leveraging [predictive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics)
or [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)
techniques.

## Modules
1. *demand.py* - predict demand using various techniques.

## Plan
This module should work more as an engine with various algorithms to perform
different prediction techniques. Helper code will be abstracted to another
name-space.
