Name-space for preprocessing data.

## Modules
1. *base* - TBD
1. *distance* - calculate distances using various methods.
2. *routing* - prep data for various routing models/algorithms.
3. *scgx* - pipeline data to an SCGX modeling environment.

## Plan
This name-space should work more as a helper with code to utilize various
techniques related to describing data.


Name-space design TBD.
