# simulate
*simulate* is an engine dedicated to various
*[simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation)* suites. The word
*simulation* is used loosely here and does not limit the engine to literal
classifications of simulation.

## Modules
1. *crossdock.py* - simulate cross-docking.
2. *schedule.py* - leverage simulated evolution of schedules through a genetic
algorithm.
3. *routing.py* - leverage *simulation* algorithms to tackle VRP.
4. *algorithm.py* - module housing various *simulation* algorithms.

## Plan
This module should work more as an engine with various algorithms to perform
different simulation techniques. Helper code will be abstracted to another
name-space.
