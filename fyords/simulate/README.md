# simulate
*simulate* is an engine dedicated to various
*[simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation)* suites. The word
*simulation* is used loosely here and does not limit the engine to literal
classifications of simulation.

## Packages
1. *genetic_algorithm* - designed to consume individuals, environments, and fitness functions for heuristic optimization.

## Plan
This name-space should work more as an engine with various algorithms to perform
different simulation techniques. Helper code will be abstracted to another
name-space. The adopted architecture will
be a shared one for other *simulate* functionality beyond genetic algorithms.
In addition to having inspiration from evolute, *simulate* (along with the
remainder of fyords) has plenty of inspiration from
[Google OR Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/).
