# simulate.util
*simulate.util* is a name-space for *simulation* helper functions and objects.

## Modules
1. *base* - module for management classes.
1. *describe* - module for categorically and statistically describing *simulate*
environments.


## Plan
The *util* name-space will house management classes to govern simulations. The
ideal use of managers will be modeled after the general purpose of managers
found and used in Google OR Tools (ortools).
