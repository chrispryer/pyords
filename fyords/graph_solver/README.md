# graph_solver
This solver is limited to solutions to
[graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) problems.

## Modules
1. *networks.py* - optimize networks of nodes based off of geographic and
directional demand data, with limited node constraints.

## Plan
This name-space should work more as an engine with various algorithms to perform
different optimizing techniques. Helper code will be abstracted to another
name-space.
