# cluster
*cluster* is aimed at identifying groups in data. See
[clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis).

## Modules
1. *greenfield.py* - cluster geographical and directional demand for origin
nodes. This is typically used in designing and optimizing supply chains.

## Plan
This module should work more as an engine with various algorithms to perform
different clustering techniques. Helper code will be abstracted to another
name-space.
