# preprocess
Name-space for preprocessing data.

## Modules
1. *distance.py* - calculate distances using various methods.
2. *routing.py* - prep data for various routing models/algorithms.
3. *scgx.py* - pipeline data to an SCGX modeling environment.

## Plan
This module should work more as a helper with code to utilize various
techniques related to describing data.
