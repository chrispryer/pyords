## The Library
The code provides everything from low level optimization engines to higher level
helper name-spaces.

### cluster
*cluster* is aimed at identifying groups in data. See
[clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis).

**Current Scope:**

1. [Greenfield Analysis](http://supplychaindetective.com/2017/08/12/network-strategy-part-1-greenfield-analysis/) -
a facility location and operation problem. *cluster* will provide a clustering
algorithm for heuristic solutions.

### genetic_algorithm
*optimize* is an engine composing of various optimization packages.

**Current Scope:**

1. [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm).


## Collaborating
Since this is a learning project, the code will be developed with the
intention of solving a real-world problem pertaining to the developer. This
will impact the evolution of this library's design. It is required for this
evolution of design strategy to be followed if you would like to collaborate.
Each problem-set must be developed in its own feature branch.
